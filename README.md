Hi, I’m ChillRB, coming to you from Australia. My journey with coding started back in Year 9, when I was working on a science project and got my first glimpse of how code could bring ideas to life. Ever since then, I’ve been exploring, experimenting, and learning whenever I can.

These days, I mostly spend my time on Web Development, building things with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, though I enjoy coding in Python as well. For me, coding isn’t just a skill, it’s a space to tinker, create, and quietly explore ideas at my own pace.

I love starting small projects, watching them slowly take shape, and discovering something new along the way. Every project feels like a little story, and I enjoy sharing the chapters as I go. I’m always curious, always learning, and always happy to connect with others who enjoy building, experimenting, or simply exploring what code can do.
